# Introduction-to-Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning
This repository contains the projects related to basics of Deep Learning and Nneual Networks.

## Description
Deep learning, which is a specialized and advanced form of machine learning, performs what is considered “end-to-end learning”. A deep learning algorithm is given massive volumes of data, typically unstructured and disparate, and a task to perform such as classification. The resulting model is then capable of solving such complex tasks such as recognizing objects within an image and translating speech in real time.

Three major drivers caused the breakthrough of (deep) neural networks: the availability of huge amounts of training data, powerful computational infrastructure, and advances in academia. Thereby deep learning systems start to outperform not only classical methods, but also human benchmarks in various tasks like image classification or face recognition. This creates the potential for many disruptive new businesses leveraging deep learning to solve real-world problems.

Deep learning has enabled innovation and transformation across a broad range of industries. From anomaly detection to video analysis, businesses have been able to leverage artificial intelligence to gain competitive advantage and even change the way their markets approach the customer experience.
